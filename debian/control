Description: Universal schema language for JSON, XML, Protocol Buffers
 Piqi is a universal schema language and a collection of tools built
 around it.
 .
 The Piqi language can be used to define schemas for JSON, XML, Google
 Protocol Buffers and some other data formats.
 .
 This package includes "piqi" command-line program that exposes some
 of the tools:
 .
  - for validating, pretty-printing and converting data between JSON,
    XML, Protocol Buffers and Piq formats.
 .
  - for working with the schemas, such as converting definitions between
    Piqi (.piqi) and Protocol Buffes (.proto), and "compiling" Piqi
    definitions into one of the supported portable data representation
    formats (JSON, XML, Protocol Buffers).
 .
 Other Piqi sub-projects include:
 .
  - A multi-format (JSON, XML, Protocol Buffers) data serialization
    system for Erlang and OCaml.
 .
  - Piq -- a human-friendly typed data representation language. It is
    designed to be more convenient for viewing and editing data compared
    to JSON, XML, CSV, S-expressions and other formats.
 .
  - Piqi-RPC -- an RPC-over-HTTP system for Erlang. It provides a simple
    way to expose Erlang services via JSON, XML and Protocol Buffers
    over HTTP.
 .
 The Piqi project was inspired by Google Protocol Buffers and designed to
 be largely compatible with it. Like Protocol Buffers, Piqi relies on
 type definitions and supports schema evolution. The main differences is
 that Piqi has a richer data model, high-level modules, standard mappings
 to JSON and XML, and comes with a powerful data representation format
 (Piq). Also, Piqi is a lot more extensible.

Description: OCaml Piqi Implementation Library (development)
 This library provides the functionality used to build the piqi binary.
 It is repackaged primarily to enable the building of piqi-ocaml, but can be
 used to implement other tools supporting the piqi language.
 .
 This is the development package, for building against the library.
